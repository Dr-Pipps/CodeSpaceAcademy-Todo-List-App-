Using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript you are going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that helps your users keep track of various tasks. You must make effective use of Object-Oriented Programming to build your application, as a result, plan it thoroughly before you start with coding.

As well as your app looking beautiful and functioning as expected, at the very least it should be able to:

• Add tasks to the list
• Delete tasks from the list
• Edit tasks
• Add due dates to tasks
• Sort tasks alphabetically
• Strike through tasks on the list
• Save tasks in their expected states and order even after the  browser has been closed.
